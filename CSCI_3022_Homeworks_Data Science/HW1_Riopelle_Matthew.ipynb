    "This assignment is due on Canvas by **6:00PM on Friday September 2**. Your solutions to theoretical questions should be done in Markdown directly below the associated question.  Your solutions to computational questions should include any specified Python code and results as well as written commentary on your conclusions.  Remember that you are encouraged to discuss the problems with your classmates, but **you must write all code and solutions on your own**.\n",

    "**NOTES**: \n",

    "- Any relevant data sets should be available in the Homework 01 assignment write-up on Canvas. To make life easier on the grader if they need to run your code, do not change the relative path names here. Instead, move the files around on your computer.\n",
    "- If you're not familiar with typesetting math directly into Markdown then by all means, do your work on paper first and then typeset it later.  Remember that there is a [reference guide](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference) linked on Canvas on writing math in Markdown. **All** of your written commentary, justifications and mathematical work should be in Markdown.\n",
    "- Because you can technically evaluate notebook cells is a non-linear order, it's a good idea to do $\\color{red}{\\text{Kernel}}$ $\\color{red}\\rightarrow$ $\\color{red}{\\text{Restart & Run All}}$ as a check before submitting your solutions.  That way if we need to run your code you will know that it will work as expected. \n",
    "- It is **bad form** to make your reader interpret numerical output from your code.  If a question asks you to compute some value from the data you should show your code output **AND** $\\color{red}{\\text{write a summary of the results}}$ in Markdown directly below your code. \n",
    "- This probably goes without saying, but... For any question that asks you to calculate something, you **must show all work and justify your answers to receive credit**. Sparse or nonexistent work will receive sparse or nonexistent credit. \n",

    "The 5 number summary includes the min and the max numbers, and includes the lower/upper quartiles, and the median. Shown clearly here are the min and max values of the dataset. Furthermore, the 25% ad 75% rows are the 1st and 3rd quartile respectively. The 50% would be the second quartile, also known as the median! Therefore, the output of this code includes the 5 number summary. The count is different in some columns because, as we know from the dataset, some schools didn't include the 10th percentile and 90th percentile statistics, therefore there are less schools to account for in those areas. They are marked on the columns as NaN. All of the mean values match up with their values calculated previously in the lab! Std is the notation for standard deviation, and is a measure of the dispersion of data away from the mean. On symmetrical data sets, roughly 68% of the data will lie within 1 standard deviation of the mean."

For example, if the $x$'s are \"large\" and the differences between them \"small\", computing the sample variance using the formula above requires computing a small number as the difference of two small numbers.
